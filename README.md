Annual estimates are included by species / taxa group as CSV files. Filenames are of the format [Species Code] + ".All.Estimates.csv".  Species codes can be found in the '[SpeciesLookup.csv](SpeciesLookup.csv)' file in the main branch.

Estimates for 1990 to the most-recent year of data available are updated annually.
